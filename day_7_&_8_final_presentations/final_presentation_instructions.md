Lightning Talk
------

In the lieu of a final exam, there will be a final presentation. It will be a 5 minute "Lightning"-style talk. [Lightning talks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk) are popular at tech conferences and Meetups. They are beneficial for the presenter (a lower stakes method of public speaking) and the audience (convey a breadth information very quickly). It is also a common format to share / demo your work to gain greater recognition within an organization.

1. Pick a technical topic that you are passionate about. It could be a algorithm, technique, a package from your favorite programming framework, or a piece of software. The topic should be data related.

2. Get instructor feedback (i.e., approval). We'll work together to make sure the topic is relevant and scoped within the time limit.
