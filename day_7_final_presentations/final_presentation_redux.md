Option Lightning Talk Redux
------

If you are not satisfied with your Final Presentation scores, you have the option to do your presentation again. 

I'll score the redux version and award at most 50% of the missing points. For example, if you originally scored `1` on "Time management". Then you scored `5`, your final "Time management" score would be a `3` because (5-1)/2 + 1 = 3.

You can still asymmetrically lose points. If the updated version is worse than the in-class version, I'll lower your score.

Guidelines:
-----

- Your slides must be public on SlideShare
- Your talk must be public on YouTube.
- Both items must have your full name, title, and professional description. This is will be part of public Data Science portfolio. You can not take them down until you get a job after graduation.
- You must always be on screen with slides. Preferred - small talking head in a box over the slides. Something like this (but without headphones) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fXb7MFtXyk
- Everything must be clear (e.g., camera in focus, I can hear you, and I can't background noise)
- You won't get the new rubric back. This will be a black box process.
