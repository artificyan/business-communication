Grading Rubric (10 points)
-------

I and /or the grader will (semi-randomly) review at least one LinkedIn profile from each team. Any errors that I find on that profile (especially spelling & grammar) will result in a significantly lower score for __all__ group members.

Given that positive and negative points are independent, you get all positive points and then loss them all (i.e., for a total of 0) if you also have the negative items. It is critical that there is nothing negative / non-professional on your LinkedIn profile.
