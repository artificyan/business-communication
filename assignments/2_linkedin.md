========

For this assignment you will work, in groups of 3-4, on your LinkedIn profiles. To complete the assignment, please go through, as a group, each of your profiles and verify that they are error-free and adhere to the best practices described in class.

Grading Rubric (10 points)
-------

I will (semi-randomly) review at least one LinkedIn profile from each team. Any errors that I find on that profile (especially grammar) will result in a significantly lower score for __all__ group members.
