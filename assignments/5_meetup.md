Meetup
========

Due Date: See Syllabus & Canvas    
Value: 10 points / 10% of final grade   

To complete this assignment, you’ll need to find a Meetup in the Data Science space that occurs within the next few weeks that has content; something is being presented, not just social event. You’ll need to attend this Meetup with 3 to 5 other students from this class. You'll introduce yourself to at least 2 non-USF people in front of your USF classmates.

Requirements:
-----

1. Each person in your group must introduce themselves to at least __two__ people that they do not know. That introduction must be in front of at least one other MSAN student.

2. The entire group must stay to the end of the presentations.

3. After the Meetup, meet as a group and discuss, for every student- stranger interaction the following:

    1. What went well?
    1. What didn’t go well?
        - Did you stuff free food in your face and fail to make a good impression? 
    1. How would you have done it differently?

4. Each group must turn-in a write-up (minimum 1 page per person), which answers the following question:

    1. Introductions:
        - For each group member, what they did well and what they could have done better?
        - If you could do it all over, what would each of you have done differently?
    1. Meetup Presentation of the:
        – Who was the intended audience of the speaker?
        – What was the purpose of the talk?
        – Did the speaker achieve their set-out goal?
        – What did the speaker do well?
        – What did they do poorly?

Just to be 100%, absolutely clear - You will go to a Meetup with at least 2 other students. Each of you will introduce yourself to at least 2 other people. As a group, write up how it went.

Guidelines:
-----

- Happy Hour events do not count.
- Meetups hosted by USF do not count.
- Arrive early. Most Meetups have a semi-formal presentation and much of the mingling occurs beforehand. It’s okay to be the first one to arrive.
- Complete this assignment earlier, rather than later, as Meetups are often canceled or rescheduled. Failure to complete this assignment by the last day of class will result in a failing grade.
- I generally approach groups of 2-3 when I do not know anyone. If you approach a single person standing alone then you may get stuck talking to them and won’t be able to get away and, if you approach a large group, you may not get a chance to introduce yourself.
- Feel free to politely leave a group if things suck.
