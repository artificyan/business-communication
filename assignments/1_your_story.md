Your Story
========

Due Date: See Syllabus & Canvas    
Value: 10 points / 10% of final grade   

We have been talking about a short, informal oral communication form dubbed _Your Story_. Over the next few months, you will be meeting many new people requiring you to repeatedly answer similar questions about yourself. The first step toward feeling comfortable and sounding interesting in these situations is to have a well-rehearsed story.

For each of the questions below, please answer the following questions:

1. Who is the audience?
1. Why is the person asking the question?
1. What is your intention?

Situations:
-----

1. __The Ice Breaker I__: You are interviewing for a Data Science Position at a hot new start-up called _Meow-Meet_ - Tinder for cat-lovers. During a cultural fit interview with a Product Manager, asks you, "Tell me a little about yourself."

2. __The Ice Breaker II__: Luck You! You have landed a job at a hot new  start-up called _Meow-Meet_ as a Data Scientist. At your first all-hands meeting, the CEO asks you, "Introduce yourself and tell us something that makes you unique."
 
4. __The Interview I__: During a culture fit interview with a product manager, you are asked, "Why did you decide to go to the USF MSDS program?"

5. __The Interview II__: During an interview with your potential future manager who is a Senior Data Scientist, you are asked, "Why did you decide to go to the USF MSDS program?"

6. __The Interview III__: During a culture fit interview with a product manager, you are asked, "What about data science interests you?"

5. __The Interview IV__: During an interview with your potential future manager who is a Senior Data Scientist, you are asked, "What about data science interests you?"

9. __The Meetup__ While at a Meetup, you strike-up a conversation with a Senior Data Scientist at a company you would like to work for. She asks you, "What do you want to do with Data Science?"

Please write up 2 answer to each question:

1. Short answer: 2-3 sentences

2. Long answer: 4-6 sentences

For this assignment, please answer the following questions using informal, oral language. Answer the questions out-loud and then transcribe your answers. Since _Your Story_ are spoken, not written, the rules of grammar are a bit relaxed. That being said, I expect these to be well-edited and free of unintentional grammar errors.

Grading Rubric 
-------

Please bring two printed copies of the assignment to class, making sure to put your name on each. You must write down answers to all of the questions and be prepared to answer them in class, but there is no need to memorize them. You may use your paper as a crutch, but the reading should be natural. Grades for this assignment will be based upon the following:

1. In-class responses (4 points): 
    
    - Volume (1 point)
    - Speed (1 point)
    - Eye-Contact (1 point)
    - Time (1 point)

2. Written responses (3 points):
    
    - For each situation, did you answer the 3 questions?
    - For each situation, do your stories have the following qualities?
        - Appropriate 
        - Unique
        - Rememberable
        - Shows your personality
    - Writing
        - Clarity
        - Grammar
    
3. Reflection (3 points):

    Now that you have done your pitch and gotten your feedback, please complete the following exercise:

    1.  Watch the recorded version of your pitch.

    2.  Do you think that the criticism was warranted?

    3.  Now that you have done this once, what would you change?

	This should be no more than 1 page, though I expect it to be around one-half a page (double-spaced).

The deliverable is your written responses and the reflection.
