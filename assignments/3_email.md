2. Correcting an error
3. Stopping gossip
4. PIP: Performance Improvement Plan

1) Asking for mentorship
---------

While attending a Meetup, you connected with a Senior Data Scientist. You exchanged contact information and she said, "Email me sometime". Since she is where you want to be in 5 years career-wise, she would be a great mentor. Please compose an email to her.

2) Correcting an error
--------

You have been working at LinkedIn for the last few months on a new project: Sales Recommender (“SR”), which is an affiliate marketing tool. SR works like this - if you sign up for SR as a “Salesperson” and someone in your network introduces you to someone outside of your network who then generates a sale, you can give “X” free month’s subscription to LinkedIn Premium to the person inside your network who linked you to the person outside of your network, or a cash tip.

Your job on this project was to estimate how much this tip, or “X” should be using some price sensitivity data that you have about LinkedIn customers, coupled with a large number of survey results from salespeople on LinkedIn. While a survey isn’t a perfect mechanism, the size of the sample coupled with the response rate leads you to believe in its veracity.

You’ve run the data a number of times, and have come to the conclusion that you should give away 3 months of premium as a tip. However, on the night before the product’s launch, you re-ran the data and noticed something interesting: it appeared the survey wasn’t localized properly and people were putting the results in their home country currency and not in US dollars. After fixing this issue, you re-ran your analysis and came to the conclusion that the proper tip should be 14 days, not 3 months. Because of the gross disparity between your prior tip estimate and current tip estimate, you believe that if the product goes live in its current state, it will be a dud. People will use it once, forget about it, and all the hard work put into it will be for naught.

Your boss has already left for the day and you decide to fire off an email letting him know about this issue.

3) Stopping gossip
------

Over the last 6 months you’ve been working hard at CandyCrack, the free-to-play video game company on their cross-title data team. It has been a fun job so far and you were glad to make the decision to work here, rather than BigLegal.com. In your spare time you’ve been doing some analysis on the effectiveness of cross game advertising. In particular, some games at CandyCrack show advertisements for other CandyCrack games, rather than selling ads to the highest bidder. You were wondering which one had higher click-through-rates, since it could be considered a proxy for the likability of the advertisements being shown.

While advertising isn’t in your domain, you are familiar enough with the database to be able to, with a few quick queries, get this information. Surprisingly, the cross-promotional advertisements had half the click through rates of the non-CandyCrack advertisements. “That’s interesting,” you think and turning around to another person in your group, you casually mention this fact, which she is also surprised about. Thinking nothing of it, you return your attention to the matter at hand: Estimating the long-term-value of customers in the newest social casino game.

A week later, you receive the following email (note that you are me@candycrack.ai) from your boss, John Stamos, the director of analytics at CandyCrack. This email also includes Kathleen, who is the VP of Marketing and Kim, Benny and Hunter who are the other data analysts under John. How will you respond to this email?

> From: kathleen <kathy@candycrack.ai> Date: Wed, Sep 16, 2015 at 2:05 PM Subject: > Click-through Rates  
> To: John Stamos <John@candycrack.ai>  
> John –  
> I’ve been dealing with a bit of an issue. I wanted to let you know that I don’t appreciate your team spreading misinformation regarding our advertising efforts. Turns out one of your data analysts has been telling people that our cross-promotional efforts are only half as effective as the advertisements that we show for other titles. I’m not sure where this information came from and what, so-called “data” your data-team is using, but the marketing analysts have spent significant amounts of time balancing a number of important factors to optimize, such as how much we get paid for each advertisements. The last thing I need is another data analyst undercutting their work behind their back.  
> If you could fix your team, it would be appreciated.  
> Kathy.  

4) PIP: Performance Improvement Plan
------

Last year you hired a junior data analyst, Bobby, straight out of undergrad. Like a lot of people in his position, he isn’t the most professional employee. In particular:

1. He is the last one to leave each work happy hour and comes in obviously hung over the next day
2. He has often missed her team’s daily 10 am scrum, instead showing up around 11 am
3. He has expressed significant negativity regarding both the direction of the company and the product he is working on
4. He has obvious "favorites": People he will work hard for, but if you aren’t one of them, the work product is on sub-standard quality

While you have been fairly hands-off with him, the interactions that he is having with others has gotten HR’s attention. After talking it over with Tom, the director of HR, you’ve decided to implement a Performance Improvement Plan or “PIP” with Bobby. The purpose of the PIP is to make it clear that if his behavior doesn’t change that he won’t have a job. The downside of this is that Bobby, when focused, has proven to be a creative and smart thinker. The value that he brings is being undercut by this behavior, so you need to correct it.

Because of a number of legal issues around employee behavior, Tom has given the first talk to him, informing him that he is on PIP and outlining the reasons why. As his direct supervisor, it is your job to document, in email, the specifics regarding how he needs to improve, making sure to BCC Tom on that email. After this email has been sent, you will print it out and go over it with him in a 1-to-1 meeting.
