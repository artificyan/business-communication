Interviewing
========

Due Date: See Syllabus & Canvas    
Value: 10 points / 10% of final grade   

For this assignment, you will work in groups of 4 or more. This assignment has a number of different parts, so make sure to coordinate everything (earlier is better) so as to not run out of time.

-----
Job Research
-----

Individually, please find a job listing for a position that you are interested in applying. The job must be obtainable (e.g. you are not going to apply to the VP of Data) and related to the data field. Find a job that you think that you would like to apply to when you graduate. Make sure to download the job posting in the event that the posting is taken down during the next week.

For this job, complete some of the background work described in class:

1. Create your Persona (a list of adjectives that describe how you want to appear)
2. Create your Selling Points (should be around 2-3)
3. Research the company:
    - Look on Crunchbase and Glassdoor.
    - What is their mission? What does the company do? What is their product?
    - How do they make money? 
    - How does the position contributes to their mission?

To complete the assignment, you will turn in the above. It should be less than 1 page. 

----
Your Work History
----

For each item in your work history on your LinkedIn, please do the following, but do not turn it in:

1. Why did you take that position?
2. What did you while you were there? Use C.A.R. framework
3. Why did you leave?

-----
Prepping for The Interview
------

The first thing that you need to do is to figure out who is going to interview whom. For each person in the group, decide (a) who they are interviewing and (b) who is going to interview them. Everyone will be interviewed at least twice and everyone is the interviewer at least twice.

If there are four people in the group, the following works well.
The letters represent people (i.e., A, B, C, D) and the right arrow is the interviewer:

A→B   
A→C  
B→C  
B→D  
C→D  
C→A  
D→A  
D→B

Next you must come up with a script. In the first case, "B" is the interviewee. “A”, “C” and “D” will come up with __two__ scripts for “B” (without “B” being present). These scripts have the following elements:

1. Ice-breaker question – do not use the same one twice for the same person.
2. Focus on one experience or item from their resume / LinkedIn profile. Ask a historical behavioral interview question about it.
3. Follow-up with 2-4 other questions about this same item.
4. Closing

----
The Interview
-----

Using your interview plan, complete the interviews. The interviews should be done with (a) only two people in the room and (b) recorded using __the interviewee__'s phone or computer. Test the recording to verify that both parties can be heard and seen throughout the recording. You can record directly to YouTube or use QuickTime Player to record. Upload the video to YouTube. Make sure to set the privacy to "Unlisted", so only people with links. I will spot check the videos. 

Each interview video should be titled with the following format: MSDS INTERVIEWER INTERVIEWEE 

Start with the script but feel free to improvise. Each interview should be between 20-45 minutes.

----
Post Interview
-----

Once the interview is complete, stop the recording. Take a 5 minute break to walk around. Come back and have the interviewer give feedback to the interviewee. Use the video to provide evidence for the feedback.

1. What went well?
1. How well did the interviewee touch on their selling points?
1. What could be improved?
1. Give the __single__ most important thing to improve. [Radical Candor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-Tcr0T9Tyw) is a good approach.


Hints
-----

- Bad feedback: “They had bad hand movements.”
- Better feedback: “They moved their hands too much and in a too fast, aggressive manner.”

- Bad feedback: “Eye-contact”
- Better feedback: “You tend to stare at the ceiling when you are thinking.”

- Bad feedback: “He spoke too much about his project.”
- Better feedback: “During one of his answers, he started rambling on about the specific details of his project. He needs to have a better summary ready to answer this question. Then check-in with the interviewer about continuing.”

Deliverables:
------

As a group:

1. Individual statements (e.g., Persona and Selling Points) from each group member with the company name and job title of their desired job.
1. All interview plans.
1. Each interviewee should write 1-2 paragraph reflection that synthesized all their feedback.
