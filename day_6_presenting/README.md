Prework
======

Before the start of class, please complete the following:

1.  Attend [USF's Seminar Series in Data Science](https://www.meetup.com/USF-Seminar-Series-in-Data-Science/)
    - Take notes 
    - Identify the elements of A. I. M.
    - What did the speaker do well?
    - What could the speaker do to improve?

2. Watch these videos:
    - [The Top 8 Business Presentation Skills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5vlkGM810) - A little too slick but still useful.
    - [Overcome Your Fear of Public Speaking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVIWqp7I6bE) - Yep! We are going after the fear.
    - [How To Give A TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohZk7pPJN8o) - TED talks are effective for spreading ideas, however do a disservice for technical and science communication.

3. Bring a rough draft of your final project (e.g., topic, outline, sketches of slides)
